# Background


This game will be similar to a trivia game with some gaming skills needed. 
The goal of the user is to answer the question and to try to collide with 
the correct sprite that matches the answer.
1) If the user collides with a sprite with the wrong solution to the trivia
question, then you lose a life.
2) After you lose, their is a play again option.

# JavaScript Assessment

This assessment aims to evaluate your knowledge of JavaScript's basic
and intermediate features. You will not be tested on HTML Canvas,
jQuery, AJAX, or Underscore templates.

You have **80 minutes**. The specs live in the `spec/` directory. Your
code should go in the `src/` directory in the file provided. Problems
are described in that file. 

**Note**: When writing global functions (i.e. _not_ defined on a prototype),
please use a **function declaration** rather than a function expression, 
otherwise some specs will not work. See example below:

```js
// Function Declaration
function foo() {}

// Function Expression
const foo = function() {};
```

## Running Specs

How to run the specs: open up `SpecRunner.html` in a browser.
