# Background


This game will be similar to a trivia game with some gaming skills needed. 
The goal of the user is to answer the question by trying to collide with 
the correct sprite that matches the answer.
1) If the user collides with a sprite with the wrong solution to the trivia
question, then you lose.
2) After you lose, their is a play again option.
3) if the player gets the answer correct then their score increases depending
    on the level.
